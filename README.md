## WELCOME!

## About Me  
I‚Äôm a positive and driven data scientist with a background in structural engineering.  

My Masters in Civil and Architectural Engineering led me to a top structural design consultancy, where I gained invaluable experience in numerical problem-solving and multi-disciplinary design. But it‚Äôs an industry limited by budgets and regulations. Hence, I‚Äôm making the transition to Data Science.  

I'm driven to develop real solutions to real problems. It's what led me into structural engineering ‚Äî the process of overcoming unique challenges, and in doing so developing technically. Now, as a graduate of Le Wagon‚Äôs Data Science & AI course, I‚Äôm using those same analytical and collaborative skills ‚Äî skills that directly translate into delivering effective, data-driven solutions.
